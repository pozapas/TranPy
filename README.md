# Transportation-modeling-in-Python
This repository helps transportation engineers and students to learn how to implement transport models in python. It is like a course in which various topics of traffic engineering and transportation planning are explained and implemented using Python. These include macro modeling in transportation planning and micro-issues in traffic engineering. The basis of this repository is based on https://pytransport.github.io/index.html. Other resources used in this repository are in the resources folder and will be updated gradually.
In general, this consists of three general parts:
- Python Fundementals 
- Data Visualization
- Stattiscas in Transportation Engineering
- Transportation Planning
